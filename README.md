# Linear-Regression

# Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and analysis of a Linear Regression model. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

# Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

# Model Description

The linear regression model implemented in this notebook is represented as:-

Y = &#946;0 + &#946;1x1 + &#946;2x2 + ... + &#946;nxn + Îµ

# Key Sections

1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Initial data analysis and cleaning to ensure consistency and quality.

2. Model Training: Fitting the linear regression model to the dataset.

3. Model Evaluation: Analyzing metrics such as R^2, p-values and residuals.

4. Visualization: Graphical representation of relationships and residuals.

5. Hypothesis Testing: Statistical tests to interpret coefficients and interactions.

# Libraries Used

1. pandas

2. numpy

3. matplotlib

4. statsmodel

# Results and Insights

The notebook covers multiple scenarios and draws conclusions such as:

1. Interaction effects between variables.

2. The significance of predictors based on p-values.

3. Insights into the strenghts and limitations of linear regression for specifc datasets.
